Aim: To classify cooking times for public recipes found on Food.com. We will be looking to test multiple different models, and combinations of models.

SVMv1: This model uses support vector classification. "The fit time scales at least quadratically with the number of samples and may be impractical beyond tens of thousands of samples." "The multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-one scheme."

Logistic Regression: This file contains 3 models that uses n_ingr, n_steps and both.
